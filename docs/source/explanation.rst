Why do we need documentation?
=============================

Explanation and motivation
##########################

Do you document your code? Do you think it is important?

Benefits of documenting your code:

- if you will get back to your code in 6 month, you will not become a detective to find out how this code works
- easy to onboard new team members
- easy to share knowledge
- if your code is open source - easy to start contributing
- easy to see purpose and motivation of each piece of code

I love this quote from `The Documentation System <https://documentation.divio.com/>`_:

  There is a secret that needs to be understood in order to write good software documentation:
  there isnâ€™t one thing called documentation, there are four.

  They are: tutorials, how-to guides, technical reference and explanation.
  They represent four different purposes or functions, and require four different approaches to their creation.
  Understanding the implications of this will help improve most documentation - often immensely.
